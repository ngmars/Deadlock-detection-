# Deadlock
OS final project

- What is the best algorithm for deadlock recovery? Should we terminate all processes associated with the deadlock, or just terminate them one by one, checking for a safe state after each termination?
- If we decide to resolve deadlocks via termination, should we terminate the process farthest from completion, or the one holding the most resources?
- Are process creation events essential to our simulation?
